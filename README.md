# 🤖 Hammad Faheem | AI Engineer | Generative AI | Voice Agents | RAG Systems  

👋 **About Me**  
I’m Hammad Faheem, an **AI Engineer** who builds LLM-powered systems — from chatbots to real-time voice agents.  
I focus on designing **agentic AI** systems that are practical, scalable, and actually solve real problems.  

Lately, my work has been centered around **voice interaction**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and **multi-agent orchestration** — especially using **LiveKit**, **Twilio SIP**, and **OpenAI**.

## ⚙️ LiveKit / Agents Problems I’ve Solved

- Integrated **Twilio SIP** with **LiveKit** for reliable inbound/outbound calling.  
- Designed a **STT → LLM → TTS pipeline** with **barge-in and interruption handling**.  
- Managed **real-time event streaming** and **context synchronization** across agents using data channels and async RPC.  
- Built a **modular multi-agent setup** for both voice and text agents under one orchestration layer.
